# Project Overview

## Project Name

Teacher Source

## Project Description

Teacher Source is a collaborative project that I began during my time at General Assembly.  This project is unqique in that my team and I worked with a UX Team to take their research and design and produce a product. The team consists of Jairo Angulo and James Mernin.  We built this app using React.js fro the front end and Express.js for the back end.  When we deployed the site, we had created static pages (such as the homepage) as well as an interactive dashboard.  Since this project is meant to grow into a resource and sharing hub for educators, we made the dashboard for uploading text resources.

In future iterations, we would like add in a login feature that uses verification, allow for document upload and download, as well as the use of tags for search and categorization of resources.  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about this project!
